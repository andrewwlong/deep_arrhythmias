This repo contains the Jupyter Notebook for predicting heart arrhythmias using deep learning using the dataset from MIH-BIH Arrythmia dataset from https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/ .

The methodology behind this notebook is explained in my Medium Blog post: https://towardsdatascience.com/detecting-heart-arrhythmias-with-deep-learning-in-keras-with-dense-cnn-and-lstm-add337d9e41f
